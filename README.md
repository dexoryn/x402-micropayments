## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dexoryn/x402-micropayments.git
   cd x402-micropayments
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3.Set environment variables: Rename .env.local to .env and update:

   ```
   WALLET_ADDRESS=your_ethereum_wallet_address
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=402
   ```

4. Get Base Sepolia USDC for testing:
   - Visit https://faucet.circle.com/
   - Select Base Sepolia and request test USDC
   - Request test USDC

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4021`

## How It Works

1. The server uses the `x402-express` middleware to protect the `/authenticate` endpoint
2. Users must complete a payment to access protected content.
3. Upon successful payment, users are redirected to /video-content to watch premium videos.
